Description: An Individual-Based Model (IBM) which simulates plant populations over time in order to try and understand the prevalance of genome duplication (polyploidy) that we see in flowering plants (angiosperms). In particular it focuses on one specific question: How does disturbance on a landscape affect the establishment of new polyploid plant species?
