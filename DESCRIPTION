Description: In particular the model focuses on attempting to answer one specific 
    question: How does disturbance on a landscape affect the establishment of new polyploid 
    plant species? In order to try and understand the prevalance of polyploidy that we see 
    in flowering plants, the plant populations in this model are subject to genome 
    duplication and landscape disturbance. The landscape is initially populated with randomly
    generated cohort of diploid juveniles. Each generation there is germination, growth, 
    competition (between adults), reproduction, and survival. Parameters and probabilities 
    affecting these stages of the life cycle can be set via the model function: disturploidy.
