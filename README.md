# How does disturbance on a landscape affect the establishment of new polyploid plant species?

Simulated plants will be initialised on a spatially explicit landscape. Their genomes will be modelled so that, over generations, both auto and allopolyploidy can occur mechanistically -- in line with some appropriate probability. Fitness costs (reproductive disadvantages) and benefits (increased stature and deleterious mutation buffering etc) of polyploidy will be parameterised to ensure a competitive element to the simulation. Plant diversification and polyploid distribution will be quantified through repeated simulations of the model across varying levels of disturbance (where the highest level causes complete mass plant death in a given area). This will test how important disturbance really is for predicting successful polyploid establishment and distribution.
