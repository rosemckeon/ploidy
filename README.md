# Disturploidy

**An Individual-Based Model (IBM) written in R.**

This model simulates plant populations over time in order to try and understand the prevalance of genome duplication (polyploidy) that we see in flowering plants (angiosperms). In particular it focuses on one specific question: *How does disturbance on a landscape affect the establishment of new polyploid plant species?*

## Installation

From your R console/script:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("rozeykex/ploidy")
```

## Usage

From your R console/script run `disturploidy()` to run a simulation. See `?disturploidy` for details on model parameters.
