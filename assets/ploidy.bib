Additionally, recent whole-genome duplications that have occurred in the lineages of several domesticated crop species, including wheat (Triticum aestivum), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and soybean (Glycine max), have contributed to important agronomic traits, such as grain quality, fruit shape, and flowering time. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and impacts of gene duplication will be important to future studies of plants in general and of agronomically important crops in particular. In this review, we survey the current knowledge about gene duplication, including gene duplication mechanisms, the potential fates of duplicate genes, models explaining duplicate gene retention, the properties that distinguish duplicate from singleton genes, and the evolutionary impact of gene duplication.},

abstract = {An approach was made to the problem of estimating rates of chromosomal evolution in plants. This was done by considering variability in chromosome number within genera whose ages are known approximately from fossil and biogeographic evidence. The relative increases in chromosome number diversity per lineage per unit time were as follows: herbaceous angiosperms, 100; woody angiosperms, 14; conifers, 2; and cycads, 0. Rates of increase in species diversity were estimated in an analogous way. These rates were strongly correlated with the karyotypic rates.These evolutionary rate differences between major groups of seed plants are largely explicable in terms of the breeding structures of populations. Herbs usually have small to moderate effective population sizes, and relatively high dispersability. By contrast, woody angiosperms and gymnosperms are usually obligate outbreeders with large effective population sizes and low dispersability. Thus the probability of fixing and dispersing new karyotypes or novel character ensembles is higher in herbs than in other seed plants.},

In contrast to other speciation mechanisms, polyploid species begin with substantial postzygotic reproductive isolation from progenitors while being sympatric with one or both. These nascent polyploid species often go extinct due to ecological and evolutionary genetic obstacles. Interestingly, polyploid species appear to quickly occupy different geographic distributions and ecological niches than their diploid progenitors. Using biogeographic data from polyploid and diploid species representing 49 genera of vascular plants, we tested whether climatic niches of polyploid species evolve faster than their diploid relatives. We found polyploid species often have less climatic overlap than expected with diploid progenitors. Consistent with this pattern, we estimated that the climatic niches of polyploid plants consistently evolved faster than the niches of diploid relatives. Our results indicate ecological niche differentiation is important for polyploid establishment, and suggest ecological differentiation is important for speciation processes more widely.},

The cytogenetic behavior of allopolyploids and autopolyploids differ statistically, but are more similar than commonly believed. The progeny of neopolyploids include a high frequency of aneuploids, pseudoeuploids and homeologue-recombinant genotypes that may contribute to the phenotypic variability observed in early generation polyploids.

The stages in polyploid evolution include frequent fertility bottlenecks and infrequent events such as gametic nonreduction and interspecific hybridization, yet little is known about how these and other factors influence overall rates of polyploid formation. Here we review the literature regarding polyploid origins, and quantify parameter values for each of the steps involved in the principal pathways. In contrast to the common claim that triploids are sterile, our results indicate that the triploid bridge pathway can contribute significantly to autopolyploid formation regardless of the mating system, and to allopolyploid formation in outcrossing taxa. We estimate that the total rate of autotetraploid formation is of the same order as the genic mutation rate (10−5), and that a high frequency of interspecific hybridization (0.2{\%} for selfing taxa, 2.7{\%} for outcrossing taxa) is required for the rate of t...},

However, previous estimates of the frequency of polyploid speciation suggest that the formation and establishment of neopolyploid species is rare. By combining information from the botanical community's vast cytogenetic and phylogenetic databases, we establish that 15{\%} of angiosperm and 31{\%} of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase. These frequency estimates are higher by a factor of four than earlier estimates and lead to a standing incidence of polyploid species within genera of 35{\%} (n = 1,506). Despite this high incidence, we find no direct evidence that polyploid lines, once established, enjoy greater net species diversification. Thus, the widespread occurrence of polyploid taxa appears to result from the substantial contribution of polyploidy to cladogenesis, but not from subsequent increases in diversification rates of polyploid lines.},

Polyploidy confers postzygotic reproductive isolation and is thought to drive ecological divergence and range expansion. The adaptive value of polyploidy, however, remains uncertain; ecologists have traditionally relied on observational methods that cannot distinguish effects of polyploidy per se from genic differences that accumulate after genome duplication. Here I use an experimental approach to test how polyploidy mediates ecological divergence in Achillea borealis (Asteraceae), a widespread tetraploid plant with localized hexaploid populations. In coastal California, tetraploids and hexaploids occupy mesic grassland and xeric dune habitats, respectively. Using field transplant experiments with wild-collected plants, I show that hexaploids have a fivefold fitness advantage over tetraploids in dune habitats. Parallel experiments with neohexaploids--first-generation mutants screened from a tetraploid genetic background--reveal that a 70{\%} fitness advantage is achieved via genome duplication per se. These results suggest that genome duplication transforms features of A. borealis in a manner that confers adaptation to a novel environment.},

One contribution of 14 to a Theme Issue 'Contemporary and future studies in plant speciation, morphological/floral evolution and polyploidy: honouring the scientific contributions of Leslie D. Gottlieb to plant evolutionary biology'. Polyploidy is a mutation with profound phenotypic consequences and thus hypothesized to have transformative effects in plant ecology. This is most often considered in the context of geographical and environmental distributions as achieved from divergence of physiological and life-history traits-but may also include species interactions and biological invasion. This paper presents a historical overview of hypotheses and empirical data regarding the ecology of polyploids. Early researchers of polyploidy (1910s-1930s) were geneticists by training but nonetheless savvy to its phenotypic effects, and speculated on the importance of genome duplication to adaptation and crop improvement. Cytogenetic studies in the 1930s-1950s indicated that polyploids are larger (sturdier foliage, thicker stems and taller stature) than diploids while cytogeographic surveys suggested that polyploids and diploids have allopatric or parapatric distributions. Although autopolyploidy was initially regarded as common, influential writings by North American botanists in the 1940s and 1950s argued for the principle role of allopolyploidy; according to this view, genome duplication was significant for providing a broader canvas for hybridization rather than for its phenotypic effects per se. The emphasis on allopolyploidy had a chilling effect on nascent ecological work, in part due to taxonomic challenges posed by interspecific hybri-dization. Nonetheless, biosystematic efforts over the next few decades (1950s-1970s) laid the foundation for ecological research by documenting cytotype distributions and identifying phenotypic correlates of polyploidy. Rigorous investigation of polyploid ecology was achieved in the 1980s and 1990s by population biologists who leveraged flow cytometry for comparative work in autopolyploid complexes. These efforts revealed multi-faceted ecological and phenotypic differences, some of which may be direct consequences of genome duplication. Several classical hypotheses about the ecology of polyploids remain untested, however, and allopolyploidy-regarded by most botanists as the primary mode of genome duplication-is largely unstudied in an ecological context.},

abstract = {Polyploidy, or the presence of two or more diploid parental genome sets within an organism, is found to an amazing degree in higher plants. In addition, many plant species traditionally considered to be diploid have recently been demonstrated to have undergone rounds of genome duplication in the past and are now referred to as paleopolyploids. Polyploidy and interspecific hybridisation (with which it is often associated) have long been thought to be important mechanisms of rapid species formation. The widespread occurrence of polyploids, which are frequently found in habitats different from that of their diploid progenitors, would seem to indicate that polyploidy is associated with evolutionary success in terms of the ability to colonise new environmental niches. A flurry of recent genomic studies has provided fresh insights into the potential basis of the phenotypic novelty of polyploid species. Here we review current knowledge of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional changes associated with polyploidy in plants and assess how these changes might contribute to the evolutionary success of polyploid plants. We conclude by stressing the need for field-based experiments to determine whether genetic changes associated with polyploidy are indeed adaptive.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
