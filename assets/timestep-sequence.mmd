  loop Every generation
    L->>L: Disturbance  # BD: Is disturbance defined by cell then, as increasing mortality?
    opt If disturbed    # BD: An issue with seedlings, juveniles, etc., is that you need multiple parameters set for survival
      S->>S: Survival
      1->>1: Survival
      2->>2: Survival
      Note right of 3: There won't be any adults or gametes at the begining of time steps.

      3->>M: Spermatogenesis
      3->>F: Oogenesis
      Note right of 3: Chance of unreduced gametes causing genome duplication.
      M-->>L: Dispersal
      alt If pollen meets adults
        M->>F: Fertilisation
        Note left of F: Chance of genome duplication here too?

        end
      else If not
        M-xM: DEATH
        Note right of M: Pollen that didn't develop into seeds die on failure.
      end
      3-x3: DEATH
      F-xF: DEATH
      Note left of F: Ova that didn't develop into seeds die with adults.
    end
    1->>1: Survival
    2->>2: Survival
    Note right of 2: I'm thinking some persistance of plants through generations might be important for distrubance to have an effect? Can maybe play with the survival chances to test that.
