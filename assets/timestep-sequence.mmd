    #L->>L: Disturbance

      0->>0: Survival
      Note right of 0: Probability = ?
      1->>1: Survival
      Note right of 1: Probability = ?
      Note right of 2: There won't be any adults or gametes at the begining of time steps.
    end
    L-->>0: Population density affects germination.
    opt If K NOT reached
      0->>1: Germination
      Note right of 0: Lottery of all seeds available to fill K?
    end
    L-->>1: Population density affects Growth.
    alt If K NOT reached
      1->>1: Individual growth
      Note right of 1: Maximum growth rate, determined by genetic trait.
      opt If large enough
        Note right of 1: Threshold = ?
        Note right of 1: Sort plants into size order.
        loop Through size sorted list
          opt If K still not reached
            1->>1: Clonal growth of largest
          end
        end
        Note right of 1: Occurs inside the cell. After making 1 clone, plants are removed from list so clones occur in size order until K is reached.
        1->>2: Become adult
      end
    else If K reached
      1->>1: Individual growth
      Note right of 1: Reduced growth rate relative to density > K (not sure if getting above K is actually possible with this logic).
      opt If large enough
        Note right of 1: Threshold = ?
        1->>2: Become adult
      end
    end
    opt If adults
      Note right of 2: Chance of unreduced gametes causing genome duplication. Also may be important to have number of gametes produced affected by genetic trait - perhaps polyploids produce more because of larger flowering events. X below could be a summation of alleles?
      2->>M: Spermatogenesis
      Note right of M: N = rnorm(1, X, 10)
      2->>F: Oogenesis
      Note right of F: N = rnorm(1, X, 10)
      Note right of M: Pollen grains compete by being randomly assigned IDs of ova in the same cell, with some probability to make sure some pollen never reaches any ova at all. Some ova get left out as they are not sampled (by chance) and so not assigned.
      L-->>M: Population density affects pollination
      M->>M: Pollination
      alt If K NOT reached
        Note right of M: Probability lower
      else If K reached
        Note right of M: Probability higher
      end
      opt If Pollination
        L->>M: Ova assigned
        Note right of M: Density will automatically affect ova assignment. Less dense cells will have a higher chance of being assigned ova from self (is that right?).
        alt If pollen competition
          Note right of M: Random winner chosen.
          opt If winner
            M->>F: Fertilisation
          end
        else If no pollen competition
          M->>F: Fertilisation
        end
        opt If fertilisation successful
          F->>0: Ova contributes to embryo
          M->>0: Pollen contributes to embryo
          0-->>L: Seed Dispersal
          Note right of 0: Range = 1
        end
      end
      Note right of F: All unsuccessful gametes removed.
      2-x2: Survival
      Note right of 2: Probability = 0
    end
    L-->>1: Population density affects survival.
    1->>1: Survival
    alt If K NOT reached
      Note right of 1: Probability = 1
    else If K reached
      Note right of 1: Sort plants into size order (Largest to smallest).
      alt If ID under K
        Note right of 1: Probability = 1
      else If ID over K
        Note right of 1: Probability = 0
