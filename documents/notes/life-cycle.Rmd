## Probability of remaining a seed (Pss)

$Pss = probability~~of~~seed~~survival$

## Probability of transitioning from a seed to a juvenile (Psj)

$Psj = probability~~of~~germination$

## Probability of remaining a juvenile (Pjj)

$Pjj = (growth~~rate * size < adult~~size~~threshold) * probability~~of~~juvenile~~survival$

The largest juveniles have the highest probabilities of survival.

## Probability of transitioning from a juvenile to an adult (Pja)

$Pja = (growth~~rate * size >= adult~~size~~threshold) * probability~~of~~surviving~~competition$

The largest adults have the highest probabilities of surviving competition. Carrying capacity controls how many adults can survive on each landscape cell.

## Probability of remaining an adult (Paa)

$Paa = probability~~of~~adult~~survival * probability~~of~~surviving~~competition$

Adult survival probability can be modified according to the occurance of inbreeding.

## Fecundity (F)

The number of seeds produced by an adult:

$F = number~~of~~ovules * probability~~of~~fertilisation$

Probability of fertilisation can be modified according to various mating rules:

- Uneven matching of parental ploidy levels

- Selfing polyploid

- Selfing diploid

- Triploid maternal progenitor
