\usage{
hard selection based on trait values. Large trait values give higher survival probabilities.
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{A population dataframe}

\item{trait}{A character string matching a column name which contains trait values.}

\item{Z}{a constant used to turn trait values into probabilities.}

\item{inbreeding_sensitivity}{number between 0 and 1 representing the strength of inbreeding. 0 = no effect and 1 is maximum effect. Checking for 100% identical alleles at the specified inbreeding locus is used as a proxy for having homozygous deleterious alleles. When this happens survival chances are modified according to inbreeding sensitivity (default = 0, so inbreeding is ignored unless set).}
}
\value{
pop reduced based on survival probabilities created from trait values.
